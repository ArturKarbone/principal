- Principal is level, whereas CTO, Team Lead are roles. Principal can play different roles.
- Such people are rare, because most developers do not qualify (too technical).

### ‚Äì Partially done work
???
- cancelled tasks (especially large ones)
- postponed tasks
- everything that is WiP, that is not bringing $:)

--

### ‚Äì Overproduction
???
- extra / unused features
- code/solution "for the future", before it's actually required
- pushing more features than QA can handle, instead of becoming QA and shipping
- writing more user stories than needed for the next Sprint
- backlog  with 12,000 stories (JIT, enough to guarantee flow, enough to make plans)
- overly complex solutions (accidental complexity)
- wrong write vs. rent decisions (nocode)

--

### ‚Äì Non-value added activities
???
- obsession with automation (MTTR, MTTD please)
- setup time, onboarding
- spending time on understanding shitty code (high discovery cost)
- refactoring functionality that does not change
- meetigs without assigning tasks and responsibilities
- metrics
- merging
- time-tracking, reports
- putting in-process defects into tracking system
- optimizing part of the process that is not a bottleneck (optimize the whole, avoid suboptimizaiton)

--

### ‚Äì Delays / waiting
???
- manual work
- testing (spec first, 0 testers). Testing is about preventing (building-in), not finding.
- BAD automation (long-running, flaky tests)
- waiting for code review, waiting for approval
- handoff / waiting someone to help you complete user story (e.g testing, ops) because of OVERSPECIALIZATION
- unplanned work (downtime, defects)
- overutilized people

--

### ‚Äì Rework
???
- failing too late
- misunderstood/miscommunicated requirements, fixing defects, fixing someone else's spaghetti code, too much upfront design
- ReLearning (answering the same questions, code conventions, meeting again...)

- to lead by example (use TDD! or "HE DOESNT USE TDD" aha...)
- to resolve disagreements, FORCES to discuss, understand, agree to proceed.
- protection against Sunk Cost Fallacy
- more fun cutting through boring tasks / shitty code
- knowledge transfer (lower bus factor, no knowledge silos, 2 ppl ready to change)
