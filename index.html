- fewer assumptions
- focus (less FB distraction :-)
- code is better because someone is watching (i come prepared.)
- to lead by example (use TDD! or "HE DOESNT USE TDD" aha...)
- to resolve disagreements, FORCES to discuss, understand, agree to proceed.
- protection against Sunk Cost Fallacy
- more fun cutting through boring tasks / shitty code
- knowledge transfer (lower bus factor, no knowledge silos, 2 ppl ready to change)
