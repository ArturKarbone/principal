# The **Principal** Developer

Who do you think is a Principal Dev?


---
class: center, middle
## A developer has achieved Principal level if he/she has competences required to effectively organize all software development activities in a company.
???
I don't like the term *department* because in many companies software development is not a separate department. It doesn't mean that you do this. But you *should* be able.

The term is often used interchangeably with CTO. The name of this course is Principal Developer because Principal means level, whereas CTO, architect, VPoE are roles. Principal can play different roles, if neccessary. It can be individual contributor, but usually it's director-level position. Market is short of people like that, because most developers do not qualify ‚Äì they are too technical and lack competence in five primary areas. That is why it is very rewarding, because companies struggle to find good candidates, and are offering very good work conditions, maximum compensation, carte blanche. But the most rewarding part is that knowledge in five primary areas allows you to connect the dots and see the big picture.

That being said, there is nothing wrong if you decide to stay purely technical. A senior developer can make happy living. Nevertheless, competence in five primary areas will make a better, well-respected professional regardless of the chosen path ‚Äì dev, consultant, businessman. You will get much broader perspective it might open new doors. Ready for the journey?

- extra / unused features

- pushing more features than QA can handle, instead of becoming QA and shipping

- wrong write vs. rent decisions (nocode)

- spending time on understanding shitty code (high discovery cost)
- refactoring functionality that does not change
- meetigs without assigning tasks and responsibilities
- metrics
- merging
- time-tracking, reports
- putting in-process defects into tracking system
- optimizing part of the process that is not a bottleneck (optimize the whole, avoid suboptimizaiton)

--

### ‚Äì Delays / waiting
???
- manual work
- testing (spec first, 0 testers). Testing is about preventing (building-in), not finding.
- BAD automation (long-running, flaky tests)
- waiting for code review, waiting for approval
- handoff / waiting someone to help you complete user story (e.g testing, ops) because of OVERSPECIALIZATION
- unplanned work (downtime, defects)
- overutilized people

### ‚Äì Rework

- misunderstood/miscommunicated requirements, fixing defects, fixing someone else's spaghetti code, too much upfront design

- better end solution and design
- fewer defects, caught early
- fewer assumptions
- focus (less FB distraction :-)
- code is better because someone is watching (i come prepared.)
- to lead by example (use TDD! or "HE DOESNT USE TDD" aha...)
- to resolve disagreements, FORCES to discuss, understand, agree to proceed.
- protection against Sunk Cost Fallacy
- more fun cutting through boring tasks / shitty code
- knowledge transfer (lower bus factor, no knowledge silos, 2 ppl ready to change)
- building common values / language
- eliminates code reviews, interruptions caused by it.
- eliminates code reviews that ALWAYS leads to rework.
- eliminates code review where the reviewer NEVER understands code well enough.
