#### #1 Self-reflection (7 min)

On a paper, rate your skills from 1 (rookie) to 10 (master Yoda). Visualize your skills on the Coaching Wheel: plot numbers on the dotted lines; connect plotted numbers with lines.

Now, assess each skill individually and think:

- How mastering that skill can help you? What doors does it open?
- How does lack of that skill is limiting you?
- How can you polish that skill?

Also think:

- Why keeping skills in balance is important?
- Why disbalance is dangerous?
- How can you maintain the balance?

#### #1 Teamwork (20 min)

Quickly share results of self-reflection with the team. Now, as a team, prepare a short presentation (3-5 minutes) that:

- Convinces audience on the importance of each skill and perils of its lack
- Shares tips/hints on how to grow each skill
- Convinces listeners on the importance of balance and perils of disbalance
- Shares tips/hints on how to keep skills in balance

Make sure that every team member speaks.

Pro Tip: start with an actual problem, and people will listen carefully

Pro Tip: if possible, interact with listeners

Pro Tip: if possible, use short real-world cases/stories/examples

Pro Tip: to sound convincing, speak loudly

### #1 Think and discuss (20 min)

1. Who is the customer in your software development process?

*In large organizations, there could be multiple customers (external and internal). The goal is to identify each group of customers, understand the process “from idea to cash” for each group, and continuously reduce the average cycle time.*

2. When the clock starts and stops in your process? Use a sheet of paper to sketch the whole process “from idea to cash”.

*In development, the clock starts when a customer places an order. The clock stops when the customer’s problem is solved. What this means will differ from one organization to the next, but the process always starts and ends with a customer.* 

*Pro Tip: customers do not care about other requests or how busy you are. They care about how long it takes for you to act on their request. Look at the whole process from the customers' perspective.*

Answer the following questions:

3. What is your average cycle time (CT)?
4. How does CT impact customers' business? 
5. What happens when CT is unsatisfactory high? 
6. How does CT impact our reputation?
7. Do you see opportunity for reducing CT? How?
8. Do you agree that devs who can reduce CT are extremely valuable? Why?

Share your results with teammates. Are there any process similarities? What are the differences? What can you learn from teammates?

### #2 Teamwork (30 min)

In a team, mark activities that reduce WiP with ❤️ and activities that increase WiP with ❌. Make sure that you understand each activity, why and how particular activity influences WiP. 

1. Monotasking
2. Multitasking
3. Pair Programming
4. Mob Programming
5. Starting working on a new feature, while testing is in progress
6. Helping testers complete testing faster (pair testing)
7. Working closely with testers before the feature is completely developed
8. Teams without testers
9. Expert and overspecialization in the team (backend/frontend/mobile/db)
10. T-shaped people (generalizing specialists) in the team
11. Geo distributed people working on the same challenge
12. Developers thinking that “done” means “coded”
13. Testers thinking that “done” means “tested”
14. People with completely different values and interests
15. Continuous Integration
16. QA or “DevOps” is a separate department with different incentives
17. Office / table layout does not enable zero-friction pairing / mobbing
18. The Principal asks everybody to reduce WiP, but works alone
19. Shotgun refactoring (shotgun surgery)
20. Moving in baby steps and keeping the code green while working on a feature
21. The team does not have pairing experience and Principal is not mentoring
22. Decoupling deployment from release (batching elimination)
23. Fear of saying *no* / accepting lots of work to *please* customer(s)
24. Leader is too busy to explain Little's Law to the team
25. Jerks in the team (knowledge refrigerators)
26. Unresolved conflicts in the team
27. Micromanagement, time-tracking and other BS
28. Isolation / work on long-living feature branches
29. Daily standups
30. Insecure environment
31. No goal / the team works on completely unrelated tasks or different projects
32. No WiP limits (pushing of work)
33. Strict WiP limits (pulling of work)
34. Dependencies on people, teams, 3rd-party
35. Long-running tests
36. Waiting for code review
37. Blocking code review / Code review is the first priority
38. Waiting for clarification, approvals
39. Unplanned work (unexpected Critical Bug found on Production)

In your project, which activities contribute to increased WiP? List three major activities. Share it with the team and discuss how to improve the situation.

### #3 Teamwork (30 min)

In a team, classify each waste from the list using *PONDR*. Make sure that you understand each waste and the cause(s) of each waste.

1. **P**artially Done Work
2. **O**verproduction
3. **N**on-value added activities
4. **D**elays / Waiting
5. **R**ework

Wastes:

1. Cancelled tasks
2. Setup Time / Onboarding
3. Suffering from high discovery cost due to spaghetti code
4. Postponed tasks
5. Work that is under development (stuff that you are coding)
6. Work that is deployed, but not yet released
7. Extra / unused features “for the future”
8. Time tracking and preparing reports
9. Putting in-process defects into tracking system
10. Re-implementing solution due to misunderstood requirements
11. Re-learning (answering the same questions, discussing the same things)
12. Unplanned work (expediting)
13. Focusing on 100% test coverage and forgetting about MTTR / MTTD
14. Building a wrong test pyramid (Ice-Cream Cone vs. Eye of Providence)
15. Code that we wrote “for the future”, before it's actually required
16. Refactoring functionality that does not change
17. Doing routine tasks manually
18. Unplanned work (downtime)
19. Team members shared across projects
20. Optimizing part of the process that is not a bottleneck
21. Gathering in-process metrics in the sake of reporting
22. Waiting for the code review
23. Non-automous teams
24. Coding more stuff while “in testing” work is piling up
25. Writing more user stories than needed for the next few Sprints
26. Maintaining a large backlog with work that won't be done anytime soon
27. Accidental complexity
28. Failing too late in the pipeline / fixing escaped defects
29. Overitulized workforce
30. Handoffs (inability to complete the work independently)
31. Meetings with low ROI
32. Impasse
33. Long-running tests (long is when you have enough time to make a coffee)
34. Dealing with merge conflicts
35. Making a wrong *write vs. rent* decisions, *on-prem vs. SaaS*
36. Writing software when Excel spreadsheet is good enough
37. Building things right before you know what is the right thing

In your project, which wastes are the most painful? List three major wastes. Share it with the team and discuss how to improve the situation.
