### The Plan



Backlog – size (just enough to avoid waiting). Twino story with large backlog.

WAIT. 

Every behaviour has a reason. (the goal behind the goal, views)

Servant Leadership or Leaders eat Last. :-) Requires confidence, because people will probe you anyway. 

Understanding Behaviour, Perception and Desires	.

Developers like people who can do things “the right way”

Let’s reduce WiP! Who the fucking you are? : )

Career and Antifragility.

Stress level and Headspace

Public Speaking

Role Model?

Career – skills that make difference, ignore noise, managing bit.

##### Influence

Self-Confidence. 

Body language and voice.

Stand Up.

Touch.

Reputation and authority (your success story? did you make a difference somewhere? did you work at the super company?)

Network and relationship.

Trust.

##### Trust 

* Low-hanging fruits.
* Work together, learn the current way.
* Hang-out together.
* Peer > Boss. (“We language”)

##### Am I a good leader? 

* One-on-Ones (up, down, sideways)
* Anonymous Feedback
* Spotify Health
* Employee Turnover / Growth



### WiP Challenge (30 min)

In a team, mark activities that reduce WiP with ❤️ and activities that increase WiP with ❌. Make sure that you understand each activity, why and how particular activity influences WiP. 

1. Multitasking
2. Monotasking
3. Pair Programming
4. Mob Programming
5. Starting working on a new feature, while testing is in progress
6. Helping testers complete testing faster (pair testing)
7. Working closely with testers before the feature is completely developed
8. Teams without testers
9. Expert and overspecialization in the team (backend/frontend/mobile/db)
10. T-shaped people (generalizing specialists) in the team
11. People working on the same codebase, but in different time zones
12. Developers thinking that “done” means “coded”
13. Testers thinking that “done” means “tested”
14. People with completely different values and interests
15. Continuous Integration
16. QA or “DevOps” is a separate department with different incentives
17. Office / table layout does not enable zero-friction pairing / mobbing
18. The Principal asks everybody to reduce WiP, but works alone
19. Shotgun refactoring (shotgun surgery)
20. Developing a feature in baby steps and keeping the code on your laptop green
21. The team does not have pairing experience and The Principal is not mentoring
22. Decoupling deployment from release
23. Fear of saying *no* / accepting lots of work to *please* customer(s)
24. The Principal is too busy to explain Little's Law to the team
25. Jerks in the team (knowledge refrigerators)
26. Untracked / Invisible work
27. Unresolved conflicts in the team
28. Lack of a common goal
29. Isolation / work on long-living feature branches
30. Daily standups
31. Insecure work environment
32. "Teammates" working on different and unrelated projects (resource sharing)
33. No WiP limits (pushing of work)
34. Strict WiP limits (pulling of work)
35. Dependencies on people, teams, 3rd-party
36. Long-running tests
37. Waiting for code review (asynchronous code review)
38. Code review is the first priority (synchronous code review)
39. Waiting for clarification, approvals
40. Unplanned work (Critical Bug found on Production)

In your project, which activities contribute to increased WiP? List three major activities. Share it with the team and discuss how to improve the situation.

### Waste Challenge (30 min)

In a team, classify each waste from the list using *PONDR*. Make sure that you understand each waste and the cause(s) of each waste.

1. **P**artially Done Work
2. **O**verproduction
3. **N**on-value added activities
4. **D**elays / Waiting
5. **R**ework

Wastes:

1. Cancelled or Postponed tasks
2. Setup Time / Onboarding
3. Suffering from high discovery cost due to spaghetti code
5. Work that is under development
6. Work that is deployed, but not yet released
7. Extra / unused features “for the future”
8. Submitting time sheets
9. Putting in-process defects into tracking system
10. Re-implementing solution due to misunderstood requirements
11. Answering the same questions, having the same discussions
12. Unplanned work (expediting)
13. Focusing on 100% test coverage and forgetting about MTTR / MTTD
14. Building a wrong test pyramid (Ice-Cream Cone vs. Eye of Providence)
15. Code that we wrote “for the future”, before it's actually required
16. Refactoring functionality that does not change
17. Doing routine tasks manually
17. Trying to maximize output, not outcome (delivering features with low impact)
18. Unplanned work (downtime)
19. Team members shared across projects
20. Optimizing part of the process that is not a bottleneck
21. Gathering in-process metrics in the sake of reporting
22. Waiting for the code review
23. Non-automous teams
24. Coding more stuff while “in testing” work is piling up
25. Writing more user stories than needed for the next few Sprints
26. Maintaining a large backlog with work that won't be done anytime soon
27. Accidental complexity
28. Adoping a technology and tools because they are trendy (Marchitecture)
29. Failing too late in the pipeline / fixing escaped defects
30. Overitulized workforce
31. Handoffs (inability to complete the work independently)
32. Meetings with low ROI
33. Impasse
34. Long-running tests (long = 1 coffee roundtrip)
35. Dealing with merge conflicts
36. Prefering flexible and abstract code over simple and direct code
37. Making a wrong *write vs. rent* decisions, *on-prem vs. SaaS*
38. Writing software when Excel spreadsheet is good enough
39. Building things right before you know what is the right thing
40. Building MVP when MVE is enough

In your project, which wastes are the most painful? List three major wastes. Share it with the team and discuss how to improve the situation.
