#### How to learn this?
- [x] Learning by doing vs. learning by reading. (waste)
- [x] Interviews
- [x] Job change
- [x] 80/20 Learning
- [x] Mindfulness
- [x] sales, marketing, nonviolent, diplomatic, influence, confidence, mindfulness, persuation)

Next step - MEASURE VALUE! : )

## Why T-shaped people, instead of specialists and generalists

- [x] Can reduce Bus Factor
- [x] Can reduce Bottlenecks
- [x] Can replace each other, if a task feels boring to someone
- [x] Can encourage pairing and cross-learning. UI and Backend never talk to each other (check standups :-))
- [x] Can do more with the same number of people (or do the same with less people).
- [x] Can adapt to varying demand. No one cares how many UI people are in the team.
- [x] Can put expertise to work on Bottlenecks.
- [x] Can replace experts, while they are working on bottlenecks.
- [x] Can help experts with clearning bottlenecks, if possible.

## Questions:
- [x] During the product demo, customer is complaining that he has gotten not exactly what he wanted. You look at the user story and see that it was not well defined. The Dev Team proposes specifying requirements in more details during Spring planning. What's wrong?

`process slowed down. We overspecified, but are things that must be discovered during the development, as we code. If we keep making assumptions, we just introduced Overspecification, but the problem did not disappear`.


## Must-include in the course:
- [x] Allow teams to present together their stuff. Take into account body language, tricks, tricky questions from the audience, "yes, and" support.
- [x] Test Engineers in are overloaded with work. What could be the cause? What's the effect of the system? How to fix?
- [x] After atteding the training about "black-box" testing, IT manager has decided to change team's structure. He has decided to move test engineers to a separate team, creating a testing team and hire a Testing Group Manager. What's the problem? What are long-term consequences? Togeher with the team, come up with a better plan and convince the manager.
- [x] Write less code.

Play with ineffective process where people are utilised, everything is once in 2 weeks (draw a bad value stream), many sources with different people involved, example of bug that need to "wait for spring end".

Demonstrate double frustration: Rejection after waiting for too long 


`and the queue size should be limited to an
amount of work that the organization can reasonably expect to do in the
near term future. Maintaining queues of several years of work serves no purpose
other than to waste reviewers' time and build up false expectation on the
part of requesters. Investing time estimating projects that will never get
done is also a waste.`

Take the area you are responsible for. Make sure that ALL INPUTS and OUTPUTS are clear to you.
Draw the process where the team delivers well, but customers are unhappy (invisible left part).
Start from smaller process (dev, then expand).

Effect of Acceleration – Leaders job.


 Every software development organization we
know of has more work to do that in can possibly accommodate, but the
wise ones do not accept requests for features that they cannot hope to
deliver. Why should we keep a request list short? From a customer's
perspective, once something has been submitted for action, the order
has been placed and our response time is being measured. Queues of
work waiting for approval absorb energy every time they are estimated,
reprioritized, and discussed at meetings. To-do queues often serve as
buffers that insulate developers from customers; they can be used to
obscure reality and they often generate unrealistic expectations.

Play out this situation:
> "How many things in this queue are we realistically never going to get
around to?" Cut all of the things you'll never get to out of the queue immediately. Be
honest. Just hit the delete key.  Don't worry, if they turn out to be important, they'll
come back at you.

Good process:
- [x] Work Limited to Capacity (both in-progress and backlog)
- [x] Slack
- [x] Predictable
- [x] Visible
- [x] PULL from demand (team pulls wore to sprint, QA pulls work for testing etc.)
- [x] Regular Cadence

Make yourself unnecessary.
Explain "why we are doing that work? Why salaries are lower? etc.".


# Process.

Expectation Mamagement, Backlog Limits and Saving no, Why 4finance asked Scrum back

Good news: developers dont understand this. Even managers dont. And business dont. You can convince easily and make a difference.

# Business.
Instead of delivering 1000 of features from the backlog over 3 years, acquire a new large customer, launch a product, save costs. You will become CTO :)
- [x] Think like A CEO. What's the measure of success for my company? # of engaged customers, new markets, net profit, stock price, retention rate, hiring rates. The evolves, so keep up with it. You will be much valued by senior executives if you understand the big picture, than just writing code.

# Influence
- [x] Leverage data, facts.
- [x] Speak my language (explain technical debt, sustainable pace to CEO).

- when you have a very limited loss you need to get as aggressive, as speculative, and sometimes as "unreasonable" as you can be. – The Black Swan.

- In order to benefit from the uncertancy, you need to be exposed to it. Go to meetups, meet new people, socialize, try differnet companies, roles, attend interviews.

big breakthroughs—not dry correspondence or telephone conversations – Black Swan


According to Rosen, this inequality comes from a tournament effect:
someone who is marginally "better" can easily win the entire pot, leaving
the others with nothing. Using an argument from Chapter 3, people prefer to pay $10.99 for a recording featuring Horowitz to $9.99 for a struggling pianist. Would you rather read Kundera for $13.99 or some
unknown author for $1? So it looks like a tournament, where the winner
grabs the whole thing—and he does not have to win by much. But the role of luck is missing in Rosen's beautiful argument. The problem here is the notion of "better," this focus on skills as leading to success.
Random outcomes, or an arbitrary situation, can also explain success, and
provide the initial push that leads to a winner-take-all result. A person can
get slightly ahead for entirely random reasons; because we like to imitate
one another, we will flock to him. The world of contagion is so underestimated!
