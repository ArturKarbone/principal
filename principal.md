#### Stand up!

People think that the right choice of words will make us sound more convincing or influencing.  Our words contributed to 10% of perception of the message. Good job example.

If you want to learn how to deliver a convincing message, you have to practice speaking in front of the audience. Secondly, you have to be aware of your body language (I enjoy observing people's body language)

*Surprise – I have recorded you, so you can analyze your body language and other people.*

*How can we incentives people to speak on public?*

Reliable person.

#### Equality language

**Expediting**

Expediting is when someone (an expeditor) personally pushes the work through the process in order to accelerate things – a critical bug fix, for example.*

Expediting = when resources are not available when work arrives & stucks in the queue.
